Ticket Tracker
==============

A very simple C++ console program that simulates a ticket queue at a service desk,
using a reserved queue slot to track whether queue is empty

Files
-----
- `queueReserved.h`   — template queue class (circular array with reserved slot)
- `ticketTracker.cpp` — main program (menu + Ticket struct)

Considerations
--------------
Make sure `queueReserved.h` is in the same folder as `ticketTracker.cpp`.


Program Menu
------------
1. Add new ticket
2. Serve next ticket
3. View next ticket  
4. View most recent      
5. Exit
